The instructions for the task were as follows:

Create two lists:
 - Orders - where new orders would appear
 - Order Config - where information about required amounts for approval for each brand would be stored

Create two automate flows:

1 - the first flow should see if orders meet the approval amount, if not, they are sent for manual approval to a designated approver. The approver 
can approve or deny the request. If denied, the item is deleted. If approved, the item is updates as approved in the orders list and in both cases,
the person who created the order request gets an email update.

2 - create a weekly order summary via email which contains a html table of all the unapproved items in the ordered list, each item should contain
a hyperlink to the order item, and information about who created the item and when.

This project helped me grasp the basics of Power Automate and Microsoft Power Platform as a whole, and has really encouraged me to delve deeper into
this side of coding!
